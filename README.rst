Pandora
=======


Pandora is a module abstraction library, that brings combinators for
handling first-class modules in JavaScript. Modules are treated as
simple native objects, which can already be handled through the
object services provided by the JavaScript language itself.


.. code-block:: js
   // some/module
   module.exports = { method1: ...
                    , method2: ...
                    , method3: ...
                    , method4: ... }

   // some/other/module
   module.exports = { method1: ...
                    , method2: ...
                    , method4: ... }
   
   // package
   var module = pandora(require('some/module'))
                  .hide('method1', 'method2')
                  .alias({method3: 'my_method'})
                  .require('method4')
                  
   var module2 = pandora(require('some/other/module'))
                   .override('method4')

   var pack = pandora.merge(module, module2)
   pack.method1()   // => some/other/module
   pack.method2()   // => some/other/module
   pack.method3()   // => ReferenceError
   pack.method4()   // => some/other/module
   pack.my_method() // => some/module


Pandora extends these core services with a series of pure monadic
combinators, which brings a declarative-ish syntax for module
definition and formal contracts a module expects to be met.

There is no need for providing a CommonJS module service under
Pandora, since the library works directly on objects. On environments
that support CommonJS modules, however, users can leverage better
modularisation and a rather more declarative syntax.

Most of these ideas are taken from Scheme, but there's plenty of
influence from Traits operator semantics and Piccola, as well.


Installing
----------

With Node.js and NPM, just do the easy-modo install::

    $ npm install pandora

    # Then require it as usual
    node> var pandora = require('pandora')


If you want to live on the edge, you can also install directly from the
`Github`_ repository.

Testing
-------

Tests are written using the `mocha`_ library, and the `expect.js`_
assertions. To run, make sure you have both in your ``node_modules``
path and just run ``mocha``::

    $ cd /path/to/pandora
    $ mocha

    # Alternatively you can use npm
    $ npm run-script test
